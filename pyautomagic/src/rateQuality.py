 Rates datasets, based on quality measures calculated with calcQuality()
 Inputs: The structure quality_metrics with the following fields:

 OHA   - The ratio of data points that exceed the absolute value a certain
 CHV   - The ratio of channels in which % the standard deviation of the
         voltage amplitude
 THV   - The ratio of time points in which % the standard deviation of the
         voltage measures across all channels exceeds a certain threshold
         voltage measures across all time points exceeds a certain threshold
 MAV   - unthresholded mean absolute voltage of the dataset (not used in the current version)
 RBC   - ratio of bad channels

   The input is an EEG structure with optional parameters that can be
   passed within a structure: (e.g. struct('',50))
   
   'quality_metrics'        - a cell array indicating on which metrics the
                           datasets should be rated {'OHA','THV','CHV','RCB'}
   'overallGoodCutoff'      - cutoff for "Good" quality based on OHA [0.1]
   'overallBadCutoff'       - cutoff for "Bad" quality based on OHA [0.2]
   'timeGoodCutoff'         - cutoff for "Good" quality based on THV [0.1]
   'timeBadCutoff'          - cutoff for "Bad" quality based on THV [0.2]
   'channelGoodCutoff'      - cutoff for "Good" quality based on CHV [0.15]
   'channelBadCutoff'       - cutoff for "Bad" quality based on CHV [0.3]
   'badChannelGoodCutoff'   - cutoff for "Good" quality based on RBC[0.15]
   'badChannelBadCutoff'    - cutoff for "Bad" quality based on RBC[0.3]
